![Working Demo of Web App](demo.gif)

## Technology Stack
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for building the model
- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) for building the web application
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for deploying the web application

## To Run the Notebook using Pretrained Weights

The path files for the models trained on landscapes, fruits, and clothes and people are available as [landscapes.pth](https://github.com/Priyansi/image-colouriser-streamlit/blob/master/app/landscapes.pth), [fruits.pth](https://github.com/Priyansi/image-colouriser-streamlit/blob/master/app/fruits.pth) and [clothes.pth](https://github.com/Priyansi/image-colouriser-streamlit/blob/master/app/clothes.pth).

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://gitlab.com/twishabansal/image-colourisation.git`
2. Open `image-colourization-starter.ipynb`.
3. To load a particular path file in your notebook, run -
```python
def load_checkpoint(filepath): 
    model = Encoder_Decoder()
    checkpoint = torch.load(filepath)
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
    
    return model
```
```
model = load_checkpoint(filepath)
```

## Train the Model from Scratch

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://gitlab.com/twishabansal/image-colourisation.git`<br>
2. Documented Code for the model is available in the repository as `image-colourization-starter.ipynb` as an IPython notebook.<br>
3. Refer to the code written to process the data, define the model, train it, and finally get a prediction.

### Datasets 
The following datasets were used to train the model-
1. [ImageNet](https://www.kaggle.com/lijiyu/imagenet)
2. [Flickr](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)
3. [Landscape Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/huseynguliyev/landscape-classification)
4. [Scene Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/nitishabharathi/scene-classification)
5. [Fruits360](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
6. [Fruit Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/fruit-recognition)
7. [Clothes Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/salil007/caavo)

## How To Run The Web App
1. Clone the repository with `https://github.com/Priyansi/image-colouriser-streamlit.git`
2. To install Streamlit - `pip install streamlit`
3. To run the app on `http://localhost:8501` run `streamlit run app/app.py`
